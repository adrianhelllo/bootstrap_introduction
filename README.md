#  Bootstrap Introduction

## - ❓ What is Bootstrap?
Bootstrap is a collection of pre-written HTML, CSS and JS code. This helps developers create better websites, faster.

## - ❓ What version?
I'm going to be working with Bootstrap 5, which is the latest stable version, although a little unsupported with some browsers, future-proof though. More specifically, as of mid-2025, the latest version is 5.3.x.

## - ❓ Why not other versions?
Bootstrap 3 has gone obsolete - it should only be used to maintain legacy projects.
Bootstrap 4 is still used in some older sites, but is also relatively outdated.

## - ❓ What source?
I'm going to be using W3Schools to get started with Bootstrap, and continuing with it next year at school.

## - ❓ Where to get Bootstrap 5?
You can either:
- Use a CDN to link it to your code
- Download it at getbootstrap.com

CDN Code:
```
<!-- Latest compiled and minified CSS -->
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">

<!-- Latest compiled JavaScript -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
```
Using CDN has some advantages over downloading it, like having the choice not to use the JS part of Bootstrap when you don't need it, and also can be faster to access for users.
