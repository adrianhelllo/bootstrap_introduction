#  Bootstrap Introduction

## - ❓ What is Bootstrap?
Bootstrap is a collection of pre-written HTML, CSS and JS code. This helps developers create better websites, faster.

## - ❓ What version?
I'm going to be working with Bootstrap 5, which is the latest stable version, although a little unsupported with some browsers, future-proof though. More specifically, as of mid-2025, the latest version is 5.3.x.

## - ❓ Why not other versions?
Bootstrap 3 has gone obsolete - it should only be used to maintain legacy projects.
Bootstrap 4 is still used in some older sites, but is also relatively outdated.

## - ❓ What source?
I'm going to be using W3Schools to get started with Bootstrap, and continuing with it next year at school.
